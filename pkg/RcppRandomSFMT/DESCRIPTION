Description: This package enables to use the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) Random Number Generator provided by http://www.agner.org/random
	Randomc in R packages, in c++ code and in R code. This random generator is very fast and is very well suited to parallelization. It can also produces
	random number using parallelization that are identical to random bumbers produced in sequential code, leading to reproducible results.
