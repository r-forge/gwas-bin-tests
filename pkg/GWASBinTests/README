How to build
------------

Prerequisites:
    - built with GCC/G++
    - only tested on linux x86_64, but should build on any platform supported by GCC/G++
    - the Random generator implementation from the randoma package requires
            - Compiler support for 64-bit integers
            - Compiler support for SSE2 and intrinsic functions
    - OpenMP support to use the multithreaded parallelized version. OpenMP
    	is available in GCC >= 4.2

Just install it the usual way. The configure script should automatically detect if you have
OpenMP support, and compile the package accordingly.

If you want more control, unarchive it, cd to the source directory, then type
R CMD INSTALL . in the console.
