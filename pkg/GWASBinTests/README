How to build
------------

Prerequisites:
    - built with GCC/G++
    - only tested on linux x86_64, but should build on any platform supported by GCC/G++
    - the Random generator implementation from the randoma package requires
            - Compiler support for 64-bit integers
            - Compiler support for SSE2 and intrinsic functions
    - OpenMP support to use the multithreaded parallelized version. OpenMP
    	is available in GCC >= 4.2

Just install it the usual way.

If you want more control, unarchive it, cd to the source directory, then type
R CMD INSTALL . in the console.
