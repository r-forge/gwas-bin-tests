Most of the source files in this directory are imported from another project: nnbc++

TO import the sources from nnbc++ in a way compatible with R build mechanism,
the files are first copied in a proper layout using a Makefile in nnbc++.
Example:

cd nnbc++
# assuming that NNBC is at the same level than nnbc++
make copy-for-R DEST=/tmp/copy; cp -r /tmp/copy/* ../NNBC/src/libsrc/; rm -rf /tmp/copy

The only files belonging to his R package in src/ are:
	Makevars.in, Makevars.in, Makevars.win.in - to set additional preprocessor options

	r_*.cpp - wrapper files to wrap nnbc++ with R
